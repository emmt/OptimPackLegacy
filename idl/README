This directory contains IDL support for OptimPack via the call_external
mechanism.

To build the shared compiled code, just type:

  > make

Note that the compilation require that the environment variable IDL_DIR
is correctly set.

To test OptimPack:

  > idl
  IDL> op_init
  IDL> op_test

To install, copy file "OptimPack_IDL.*" and files "*.pro" into some
directory, say DIR, make sure DIR is in your IDL_PATH.  Then, _before_ you
can use OptimPack routines, you must initialize the package with the
correct name of the shared code, for instance:

  IDL> op_init, DIR + "/OptimPack_IDL"

You can have a look at the examples in "op_test.pro" (Rosenbrock's
banana function) and in the doc comments in "op_vmlmb.pro".

Enjoy !
